# éCrit

## Overview

Welcome to éCrit - a social art reviewing hub with the goal of coming to a more collective understanding of the meaning of contemporary art

### Problem

After working in art galleries and museums for 5+ years, I have identified a deepening disconnect between the public and the institutional understandings of what makes up contemporary art. Galleries and museums often feel as if their intention is to keep viewers at a distance - as if they themselves believe contemporary art is a farce, so they use pretension to uphold the foundation that's crumbling beneath them. But they're wrong - contemporary art is full of amazing thinkers who, through their work, seek to reimagine the world around them and dismantle the structures they're critiquing. To skip to the heart of this, we need to shift the meaning-making from the institution to the public, and learn about art from people like ourselves!
